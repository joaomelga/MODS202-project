    "As for the histogram of residuals, if it has a mean of 0 but high variance, this could suggest the presence of collinearity among your independent variables. Collinearity refers to a situation in which two or more predictor variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated, meaning that one can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy.\n",

    "In the presence of collinearity, the estimate of one variable’s impact on the dependent variable price while holding the others constant may not be reliable. The standard errors can be inflated, leading to larger confidence intervals or non-significant results (due to higher p-values), even if the predictor variables are truly related to the outcome.\n"

    "\n",
    "Regarding the histogram of residuals, if it has a mean of 0 and low variance, this suggests that the model’s assumptions are likely being met. The residuals of a well-specified linear regression model should be normally distributed with a mean of 0, and having low variance indicates homoscedasticity at a certain level, which is another assumption of linear regression. However, it’s always a good idea to conduct formal statistical tests or use diagnostic plots to check these assumptions more rigorously."

Consequently, the variance of $y$ $Var(y|x)$ will also depend on $x$. This violation of the homoskedasticity assumption can lead to issues, such as biased standard errors and inefficient parameter estimates in Ordinary Least Squares regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example studied in course, the examination of the education-wage relationship underscores the challenge posed by heteroskedasticity. The quest for an unbiased estimation of education's impact on wages necessitates the assumption $E(u|educ) = 0$, accompanied by the assumption of homoskedasticity $Var(u∣educ) = \\sigma^{2}$. This implies constant wage variance $Var(wage∣educ) = \\sigma^{2}$ across education levels, allowing for varying mean wages while assuming consistent variance. However, the realism concern is acknowledged: higher education levels may introduce greater wage variability due to diverse job opportunities, contrasting with lower variability at lower education levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expanding on this, assume we build a model assuming homoskedasticity, implying constant error term variance across education levels. In the real world, individuals with higher education may experience more diverse work opportunities, leading to increased wage variability. Conversely, those with lower education levels may face fewer opportunities, resulting in reduced wage variability. Thus, insisting on homoskedasticity introduces bias into the model, as it overlooks the varying wage volatility associated with different education levels."

    "The principle of parsimony, related to Ockham's razor, emphasizes favoring simpler explanations or models. In the context of information criteria like Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which balance goodness of fit and model complexity, parsimony is reflected by penalizing overly complex models. This encourages selecting models that effectively explain data while remaining as simple as necessary, aligning with the philosophy of Ockham's razor to prefer simplicity in explanations."

    "Autocorrelation of errors occurs when the error terms within a regression model present correlation among themselves. This implies that the errors in a given period are influenced by the errors in preceding periods, violating the assumption of error independence. The autocorrelation brings challenges for ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation: while the estimated regression coefficients remain unbiased, they lose the characteristic of minimum variance. In addition to that, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) may significantly underestimate the true error variance, and the standard error of regression coefficients may substantially underestimate the actual standard deviation. In these cases, the conventional statistical intervals and inference procedures cannot be applied."
